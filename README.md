# This is a motherfucking form.

<PUT FORM HERE>

And it's fucking perfect.

## Seriously, what the fuck else do you want?

You probably design forms and think your shit is special. You think the fact that your custom select box is going to get you some fucking Awwwwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think that removing labels saves precious fucking space. Wrong, motherfucker. Let me describe your perfect-ass web form:

* Every form has a fucking submit button
* Every field has a fucking label
* Every group of checkboxes or radios has a fucking fieldset (and legend bitch)
* Every control gets native behaviour, custom to that device etc

### Well guess what, motherfucker:

You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this shit. It's a motherfucking form. Why the fuck did you spend so much time removing labels and relying on placeholders just because you don't give a shit about anyone but yourself.
