## Seriously, what the fuck else do you want?

You probably design forms and think your shit is special. You think that your custom select box is going to get you some fucking design award that you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think that removing labels saves precious fucking space. Wrong, motherfucker. Let me describe your perfect-ass web form:

* It's got a submit button
* Each control has a label
* It embraces the native browser behaviour
* It uses a fieldset and legend for grouping

### Well guess what, motherfucker:

You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this shit. It's a motherfucking form. Why the fuck did you spend so much time removing labels and relying on placeholders just because you don't give a shit about anyone but yourself.

You never knew it, but this is your perfect form. Here's why.

## It's got a submit button

You thought that removing the submit button would clean up the UI or some shit like that. You thought Javascript is ubiquitous and that using it somehow makes you cool.

I guess you also thought it was a good idea to do some awesome shit, as the user is typing. Wrong, motherfucker. Get off the users back, and show some fucking respect.

This form has a submit button, and guess what? It's clear what this form does and how to submit it, in every fucking browser known to man, with a keyboard, mouse, finger, thumb or screen reader, you dumbass.

## Every field has a fucking label

You think you're a designer? Then fucking learn how the web actually works. You think omitting labels is acceptable. No. It's never acceptable. Get your head out of your own ass, and serve the user. You do remember what a user is don't you?

## It uses fieldsets and legends where necessary

Oh, gee, you don't know what a fieldset is? You think your a professional designer? Well, guess what motherfucker, you're obviously not. Go and work in McDonalds, or draw a picture.

## It uses placeholders, where possible

Just because you got a boner when the placeholder was released, doesn't mean you can stop using labels. This form uses them as additional bonus prompts and it works in newer browsers and degrades in shitty browsers. Remember, that's how the web works, that's why you're meant to be designing *for* the web, that's why your job title is "web designer", you dumbass. Unless you just changed your title to "UX designer" to sound cool, idiot.

## It fucking works

Look, you can enter information and submit the fucker, that is if you're able to type, motherfucker.

You didn't need to fix anything, it wasn't broken to start with.

Cross-browser compatibility? Load this motherfucker in IE-fucking-4. I fucking dare you.

## This is a form. Look at it. You've never seen one before.

All you have ever seen are shitty forms built by greenhorn developers, hamstrung by designers, masquerading as professionals.

### Yes, this uses default styles, you fuck

I'm not actually saying your shitty form should look exactly like this. You could put a little bit of effort in, and make them much better. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with forms are ones we create ourselves. Web forms aren't broken by default, they are functional, usable and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-bitch.
