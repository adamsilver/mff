# This is a motherfucking form.

<form>
	<div>
		<label for="firstName">First name</label>
		<input type="text" placeholder="Type your first name here bitch!">
	</div>
	<div>
		<label for="telephone">Phone number</label>
		<input type="number" placeholder="">
	</div>
</form>

And it's fucking perfect.

## Seriously, what the fuck else do you want?

You probably design forms and think your shit is special. You think the fact that your custom select box is going to get you some fucking Awwwwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think that removing labels saves precious fucking space. Wrong, motherfucker. Let me describe your perfect-ass web form:

* Every form has a fucking submit button
* Every field has a fucking label
* Every group of checkboxes or radios has a fucking fieldset (and legend bitch)
* Every control gets the intended browser/device specific behaviour

### Well guess what, motherfucker:

You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this shit. It's a motherfucking form. Why the fuck did you spend so much time removing labels and relying on placeholders just because you don't give a shit about anyone but yourself.

## Every form has a submit button

You dumbass. You thought that removing a submit button would clean up the UI or some shit like that. You thought everyone has fucking Javascript, and that using it somehow makes you cool. I guess you also thought it was a good idea to do shit as the user is typing. You are wrong, motherfucker. This form has a submit button, and guess fucking what, it's fucking clear what this form does and how to submit it, in every fucking browser known to man.

## Every field has a fucking label

Call yourself a professional? You think some fields can forgo a label. No, idiot, see how every field above has a label, even a multiple field, like expiry date. Idiot. It's been known since like forever that every field needs a label, becuase it helps the user you dumbass.

## Every group of checkboxes or radios has a fieldset and legend

## It fucking works


## It's fucking lightweight

This form weighs in at a matter of bytes, you dumb fuck. You didn't need some special library or framework to make the controls look exactly the same on different devices you ignorant fuck.

Your users don't give a fucking shit.

This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your fucking Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the fucking background color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a shitty webfont just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You piece of shit.

## It's responsive/cross-browser

This form, with nothing but HTML, works fucking every where you dumbass. You thought you needed some library wizard shit. No.

You dumbass. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever motherfucking screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a motherfucking Tamagotchi.

## It fucking works

Look at this shit. You can read it ... that is, if you can read, motherfucker. It makes sense. It has motherfucking hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you and your bitch-ass browser know what the fuck's in this fucking site. That's semantics, motherfucker.

It has content on the fucking screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.

Cross-browser compatibility? Load this motherfucker in IE6. I fucking dare you.

## This is a website. Look at it. You've never seen one before.

Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no fucking idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are shitty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communicating a fucking message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's fucking beautiful.

### Yes, this is fucking satire, you fuck

I'm not actually saying your shitty site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are ones we create ourselves. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-bitch.
