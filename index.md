# This is a motherfucking form.

And it's fucking perfect.

<form action="http://google.co.uk">
	<label for="firstName">First name</label>
	<div>
		<input id="firstName" type="text" placeholder="Type your first name here bitch!">
	</div>
	<label for="tel">Phone number</label>
	<div>
		<input id="tel" type="number" placeholder="Type your phone number duh">
	</div>
	<fieldset>
        <legend>Favourite colour</legend>
        <div class="choice">
            <input type="radio" name="colour" id="colour">
            <label for="colour">Red</label>
        </div>
        <div class="choice">
            <input type="radio" name="colour" id="colour2">
            <label for="colour2">Blue</label>
        </div>
        <div class="choice">
            <input type="radio" name="colour" id="colour3">
            <label for="colour3">Yellow</label>
        </div>
    </fieldset>
	<input type="submit" value="Submit the form">
</form>

## Seriously, what the fuck else do you want?

You probably design forms and think your shit is special. You think the fact that your custom select box is going to get you some fucking Awwwwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think that removing labels saves precious fucking space. Wrong, motherfucker. Let me describe your perfect-ass web form:

* Every form has a fucking submit button
* Every field has a fucking label
* Every group of checkboxes or radios has a fucking fieldset (and legend bitch)
* Every control gets the intended browser/device specific behaviour
* Placeholders are added as a bonus, dumbass.

### Well guess what, motherfucker:

You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this shit. It's a motherfucking form. Why the fuck did you spend so much time removing labels and relying on placeholders just because you don't give a shit about anyone but yourself.

## Every form has a submit button

You dumbass. You thought that removing a submit button would clean up the UI or some shit like that. You thought everyone has fucking Javascript, and that using it somehow makes you cool.

I guess you also thought it was a good idea to do shit as the user is typing. Wrong. Get off the users back, and show some fucking respect.

This form has a submit button, and guess what? It's fucking clear what this form does and how to submit it, in every fucking browser known to man.

## Every field has a fucking label

You think you're a designer? Then fucking learn how the web actually works. You think omitting labels, even if it's just once, is acceptable. No.

See this form, it has a label for every field. And guess what, it helped your users, remember those fuckers?

## Every group of checkboxes or radios has a fieldset and legend

Oh you haven't heard of a fieldset or legend? Are you designing websites? Well, you need to stop calling yourself a professional. You're not.

## It's fucking lightweight

This form weighs in at a matter of bytes, you dumb fuck. You didn't need some special library or framework to make the controls look exactly the same on different devices you ignorant fuck.

Your users don't give a fucking shit.

This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your fucking Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the fucking background color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a shitty webfont just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You piece of shit.

## It's responsive/cross-browser

This form, with nothing but HTML, works fucking every where you dumbass. You thought you needed some library wizard shit. No.

You dumbass. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever motherfucking screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a motherfucking Tamagotchi.

## It fucking works

Look at this shit. You can enter information and submit the fucker, that is if you're able to type, motherfucker.

It makes sense, you can understand what you need to type.

It's using HTML5 inputs and placeholders as a bonus, so if you do actually use a modern browser it works a bit better, without destroying the experience for older browsers, you ignorant fuck.

You didn't need to fix anything, it wasn't broken to start with.

Cross-browser compatibility? Load this motherfucker in IE6 or IE4. I fucking dare you.

## This is a form. Look at it. You've never seen one before.

Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no fucking idea what a form is. All you have ever seen are shitty forms built by idiot developers hamstrung by their fellow team mate web designers, all pretending to be professionals.

### Yes, this uses default styles, you fuck

I'm not actually saying your shitty form should look exactly like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with forms are ones we create ourselves. Web forms aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-bitch.
